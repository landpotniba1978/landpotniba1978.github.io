In commercial and residential glass manufacturing, two common glass types include Borosilicate and Soda-lime silicate. The timeline of a crack spreading, the risk of it shattering and whether or not the glass will need a full replacement is different for every situation. The glass was then reheated and either mold or hand blown into the shape the glass blower desired. The reheating of the glass sealed the cracks.

We feel CRACKLE GLASS is the most beautiful. Have youever seen CRACKLE GLASS in a window when the sun reflects off the glass? Awindow decorated with different colored crackle is truly breathtaking.<p align='LEFT'>Crackle Glass is known by other names, such as CRAQUELLE GLASS, ICE GLASS, OVERSHOT GLASS. </p><p align='LEFT'>It was the Venetian Glass Makers of the 16th Century, who invented this marvelous process. The glass was immersed in cold water while it was molten hot, thereby cracking the glass. The glass was then reheated and either mold or hand blown into the shape the glass blower desired. The reheating of the glass sealed the cracks. If you run your handsover CRACKLE GLASS, you can feel the cracks, but the inside is smoothto touch.</p><p>Glass makers from the 19th Century and even today are still usingthe same methods.</p><p>Some of the companies that produced CRACKLE GLASS are: Blenko GlassCompany, Pilgrim Glass Company, Mt. Washington Glass Company, H.C. Fry GlassCompany, Boston &amp; Sandwich Glass Company, Hobbs, Bruckunier &amp; Company,Cambridge Glass Company, Kanawha Glass Company. Some of these companies are still operating today, making CRACKLE GLASS.</p><p>We will never forget the day my wife and I discovered CRACKLE GLASS. Oneday about five years ago, during the month of August, we were in a fleamarket in Commack, Long Island. We were browsing the different dealers, andI heard a vendor ask a customer, 'Would you give me three dollars for thisamber cruet?' The woman answered, 'No'. I immediately stepped forward andsaid that I would take the cruet for three dollars. </p><p>That was it. We werehooked, and five years later, we have a collection ofaround four-hundred pieces. We go to tag sales, garage sales, flea markets,auctions, advertise in the papers, pamphlets, circulars, business cards, anyway to obtain CRACKLE GLASS.</p><p>In our books on Crackle Glass, we show the different shapes, sizes,colors of the cruets, miniature vases, miniature pitchers, large vases,large pitchers, decanters and many other beautiful items. We alsoinclude a price guide to show the novice collector or the advanced collectora range of prices in order to assist in the purchasing of CRACKLE GLASS.</p><p>Make sure you check the pieces you are about to buy, to see that they are in good condition; thatthey are not chipped or CRACKED (even though it is called CRACKLE GLASS).We have made the mistake many times in purchasing a piece of glass, beingover-zealous, not carefully checking the piece, and thinking we have a greatbuy, only to go home and see the piece is defective. </p><img src='https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/33/Risky_Business.jpg' alt='Glass soundtrack crack free' title='Glass soundtrack crack free'><p>Any defects willautomatically devalue the piece. We suggest you hold up a piece to thelight and turn it slowly in all directions to see if there are anyimperfections. Make sure your piece is properly wrapped to protect it untilyou get home.</p><h2 id='glass-soundtrack-crack-full'>Glass Soundtrack Crack Full</h2><p>In closing, please be aware that there is new CRACKLE GLASS being producedtoday out of Taiwan and China. Fenton Glass Company and Blenko GlassCompany are also producing New CRACKLE GLASS today. By using our book as your guide, you will be able to distinguish the new from the old. The olderpieces will show more wear marks on the bottom and inside where a stoppermay have been. (A cruet or decanter with a stopper or top to it is worthmore than a piece without it) We have noticed that the shapes are moreimperfect in the older pieces. You may see that they may lean to one sideor you may feel bumps or variations in the glass that you cannot see. Thefewer cracks or 'crackles' a piece has the cheaper the piece of crackle should be.</p><h3 align='LEFT'>Article 2: Help in Valuing Crackle Glass</h3><h4 align='LEFT'><font color='Maroon'>by Stan &amp; Arlene Weitman</font></h4><br>Crackle Glasshas become highly collectible. It is finally holding its own in the worldof antiques and collectibles. Up until last year, when our book,'Crackle Glass Identification and Value Guide' was published, crackle glass was not taken very seriously by many dealers and collectors, who passed over it because it was hardly known.<p>Not anymore, IT'S HOT. Prices have soared, and pieces that were so easyto find are just not there anymore. People are holding on to crackle glass.Dealers are putting high prices on crackle glass, and collectors are morethan willing to pay the prices. </p><p>When we go into antique shops, the dealersoften tell us that crackle glass is their hottest item, and it's heretoday, gone tomorrow.</p><p>Being glass collectors, we became hooked on crackle glass when we saw itshimmering in the sun. We think it is absolutely beautiful. You would tooif you saw how the light reflects and refracts off the cracks. The glasslooks alive.</p><p> A window decorated with different colored crackle glass istruly breathtaking. It never fails to amaze us how quickly people become as hooked as we arewhen they see our display at antique and collectible shows. </p><p>We have now set up the first crackle glass club in the United States.We have members from all over the country. Our members buy, sell and tradecrackle glass between each other. They also compare prices from one area ofthe country to the other. We also send out a newsletter three times a year.</p><p>From the late 1920's to early 1960's crackle glass was made in many vibrantcolors, by many different companies in West Virginia, in many other states,and even abroad. It was also made in the 1880's. We are constantlyasked how can you distinguish the old from the new. Just as with any othercollectible, it is very important for a collector to research as thoroughlyas possible the subject matter. We would suggest that by studying our book,and visiting reputable antique shops, to obtain hands-on experience, youwill learn to distinguish the old from the new. </p><p>We can tell you that thestyles, color and feel of the new crackle being made today, is differentfrom the crackle being made in the past. Much of the new crackle is beingimported from China, Taiwan, the Phillippines and Mexico. Most of the oldcrackle has a nice ring to it, as the glass was of better quality. Theexception to this is the good quality crackle glass that is still being made today by theBlenko Glass Company of West Virginia. For years, Blenko continued tomake crackle, but only specific pieces. Today, they have extended their crackleline.</p><center><h3>Article 3: Overshot Glass</h3><h4><font color='Maroon'>by Stan &amp; Arlene Weitman</font></h4></center><p align='LEFT'>Overshot Glass is the name used in the USA for crackle glassware that was made from about 1870 up to the early turn of thecentury.Like crackle glass, it originated as a way of hiding defects in the surfaceof glass.There was an abundance of items produced, such as vases, pitchers, baskets,ladles, dishes, etc. </p><p align='LEFT'>Like crackle glass, there were several methods of makingovershot. The first way was that the gather of hot glass was rolled over asteel platethat was covered with thousands of very small pieces of glass. They adheredto theglass. They were very sharp, sharp enough that they could cut hands at theslightesttouch. The gather was then returned to the ovens and reheated, melting the smallpieces of glass, this melting causing them to lose their sharpness. The gather of glass was thenreheated andthen blown into a desired shape. <a href='/steve-jacksons-sorcery-the-complete-collection-for-mac.html' title='Steve jackson' s="" sorcery="" -="" the="" complete="" collection="" for="" mac="" torrent'="">Steve jackson's sorcery - the complete collection for mac torrent</a>. This produced a wide thickness between thepieces of glass. The thickness varied from one piece to the other, depending howbig the piece was made. The surface of this glass was usually smooth.</p><p align='LEFT'> The secondprocess involved the glass being blown into the original form first, andthen rolledinto glass fragments. The surface of these items were sharp to the touch with noavenues between the fragments. </p><p align='LEFT'>DO NO CONFUSE OVERSHOT GLASS ORANY TYPE OF CRACKLE GLASS WITH THE TREE OF LIFE PATTERN.THIS PATTERN WAS ALWAYS PRESSED INTO A MOLD. </p><p align='LEFT'>If you look verycarefully at some overshot glass items, you can see the glass is crackledunderneath thesmall pieces of glass. Some of the companies that produced overshot glassare: TheBoston and Sandwich Glass Company, Hobbs, Brockunier &amp; Company, FalconGlass Works, as well as abroad, such as France, England and Bohemian factories.</p><p align='LEFT'>Most early pieces of overshot glass were clear, the colored pieces coming alittlelater on. Colored overshot was produced by dipping the gather of clear glassinto apot of colored glass. American overshot glass was never made with theblending ofcolors such as amberina. The blending of colors was produced by England. All ofthe colored overshot glass (not blending of colors) was done by Czechoslovakia.</p><p align='LEFT'>Overshot glass was never pressed into a mold, although some were mold blown.Pieces made in Czechoslovakia are often acid etched CZECHOSLOVAKIA. </p><p align='LEFT'>The price of overshotglass isvery expensive compared to regular crackle glass. Even though there was anabundance of overshot glass made, it is very hard to come by, much is not seen.</p><p align='LEFT'>The research for the overshot article was taken from 'The Collector'sEncyclopediaof American Art Glass' by John A. Shuman, III, an article on 'The Glass IndustryIn Sandwich' by Barlow &amp; Kasiser, 'The Pittsburgh Glass Journal', Vol. 1, No. 7Insert by Thomas Crawford, '19th Century Glass' by Thomas Nelson, 1959.</p><h3>Article 4: Uranium Crackle Glass</h3><h4><font color='Maroon'>by Stan &amp; Arlene Weitman</font></h4><p><br></p>For many years before writing our first book, we had no ideathat we had any uranium or vaseline crackle glass, or even what vaseline glass was.<p>One day, we purchased a piece of regular glass that we were told wasvaseline glass. We immediately went to our local book store andpurchased a book on vaseline glass. ('Yellow-Green Vaseline' by Jay L.Glickman). The book taught us the only way to find out if you have truevaseline glass is by subjecting the piece to a black light. Vaselineglass will fluoresce. This is because vaseline glass contains uraniumoxide.</p><p>'The ultraviolet is the key factor in the identification ofvaseline glass. This light, often called 'black light' emits highenergy emissions of electrons. In the case of vaseline glass, whichusually contains about two percent uranium oxide, the light's strongflow of electrons has an unsettling effect on the relatively unstableuranium atom. The electrons circling the nucleus of the atom are pulledout of the orbit towards the ultraviolet light and back to the nucleusagain. Resulting energy is in the form of yellow-green lightcharacteristic of uranium.'</p><img src='https://i.pinimg.com/originals/2b/bb/87/2bbb875587e39a143f2adec9d75aad59.jpg' alt='Soundtrack' title='Soundtrack'><p>Having a black light on hand, one day we decided to scan our crackleglass collection. To our surprise, many pieces fluoresced, even piecesthat did not look green glowed. There are other types of glass thatwill glow: Burmese and custard glass, the latter two also containinguranium oxide.If you have two pieces of crackle glass that are similarly the same, butone is vaseline glass, the price of that piece should be valued muchhigher (40-50 percent higher). </p><p>When vaseline glass was invented it wasnot called vaseline glass. It was called 'Uranium glass' or 'Canaryglass'. In the 1950's the antique dealers renamed it because it had thesame color as vaseline petroleum jelly.</p><p>Back in the late 1880's there was an abundance of vaseline glassproduced by many companies. (Fenton, McKee, New England Glass Company,Boston &amp; Sandwich Glass Company, Duncan &amp; Sons, Hobbs, Bruckonier) There is a lot of vaseline glass on the shelves, tables of dealers thatare not marked vaseline glass because a lot of dealers and collectorsare not familiar with this glass. </p><p>So, if you get yourself a blacklight, go to the shows and the shops and you will be able to findexcellent buys on vaseline crackle glass.Vaseline glass came in all shapes, sizes, different types of wares: Door knobs, finials, cruets, plates, etc. We have in our collection apunch bowl set, plates, glasses, cruets. <a href='/expansion-europa-universalis-iv-common-sense-for-mac.html'>Expansion - europa universalis iv: common sense for mac</a>. The hand-held black light costabout $25, and they can be purchased from the antique trade magazines. </p><p>You will be amazed when you take a piece into a room, shut the lightsoff, put on the black light and see how the pieces glow. </p><p>We hope you enjoy this article as much as we enjoyed writing it.</p><br><p align='LEFT'><font color='#800080B'>If you are looking for crackle glass, you can usually find a selection on offer on ebay. <b>Click here to see the Crackle Glass available just now.</b></font></p><font color='#800080B'><b><br></b></font><p><font color='#800080B'>If you have enjoyed this article you will enjoy the books listed below.
