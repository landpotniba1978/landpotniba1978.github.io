the top 20 best. When it comes to Pokemon rom hacks everyone is going to have there own opinion on which ones they like the best for different reasons. These hacks vary greatly when it comes to story, theme, difficulty and Catch-able Pokemon. Anyone who has played most of the hacks listed would probably rank them differently, However, this is a great list if you are looking for the best available on the GBA so far. Download a few that might interest you, and find out what you like the best.</p><p><strong>NOTE: </strong>The majority of the following hacks are completed. Some Hacks ranked are still in beta, but are nearly completed or fully playable from start to finish.</p><h2><span>20. Pokemon CAWPS</span></h2><p>New HGSS complete history overhaul hack rom By ZeroxUy, August 11, 2019 hgss; Hack Rom (and 1 more) Tagged with. Pokemon bw2 rom hacking (and 7 more) Tagged with. Mar 26, 2020 This is one reason why, although there are hundreds of Pokemon ROM hacks available online, but many of them are still under development stage, and only a few were considered as completed. You are always welcome to recommend your favorite completed Pokemon rom hack, use the comment form below.</p><p>– Created By Crizzle<br>In Pokemon CAWPS you play as young woman or guy that becomes a police officer in the Hoenn region. This hack is for mature audiences only. It features a lot of very offensive language and content so be ready for that before playing. Encountering drug dealers, murderers, scum bags and crazy people might not be your thing. I found some of it to be funny at times, while some of it felt forced also. I can see more sensitive players hating this sort content though. The main highlight is you get to play as a police officer, that’s really cool. Be sure to grind a lot, as certain areas have difficulty spikes. Pokemon up to gen 3 (386 of them) have been added to CAWPS. Overall a decent cop vs bad people sort of story, that won’t be for everyone.</p><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eDFk5udd1bo/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Pokemon Rom Hacks Online' title='Pokemon Rom Hacks Online'><div><br></div><h2><span>19. Pokemon Outlaw</span></h2><p>– Created By Crizzle<br>In Outlaw, you play as a homeless 15-year-old boy who lives in the slums of the Kanto region. He dreams of making it big someday and be a Pokemon master. Most of the people in this world are very rude, gross, weird and negative. Some of the commentaries are funny, strange and violent, it might be offensive to many players though. It’s another mature one by creator Crizzle. It deals with the hardships of life living at rock bottom. The majority of the people in the world of Outlaw are very poor, it’s not a happy story at all, but I thought it was different and enjoyable as long as you can handle the over the top negative dialogue.</p><h2><span>18. Pokemon Korosu</span></h2><p>– Created By Crizzle<br>“Korosu” means to kill in Japanese. There is a lot of killing going on in Pokemon Korosu. This is another one for mature audiences that can handle sensitive content. Inspired by the Kill Bill movies, you play as a young girl with nothing to lose. Her family has been killed and a gang had captured her to be a slave for them. She eventually escaped and is now out to make the ones that killed her family and slaved her, pay for what they have done with death. In some instances, the hack will let you make moral choices to kill or let scumbags go. The game takes place in the Sevii Islands and Kanto Regions. All Pokemon from up to gen 3 have been added with a few from gen 4 also. Like other hacks created by Crizzle, level spikes come out of nowhere, so be sure to grind a lot. Overall Korosu is a pretty good violent revenge-themed game.</p><h2><span>17. Pokemon Fuligin</span></h2><p>– Created By Sloo<br>– See It On Amazon<br>Pokemon Fuligin is a simple but very solid rom hack where you play as a boy or a girl in the small region of ALORA. Following your big brother’s footsteps, you will eventually join Team Rocket on a quest to work yourself through the ranks to become a leader in Team Rocket. This hack features new gym leaders, All Pokemon up to gen 3 and difficulty that scales up Gradually while playing. So you won’t have to grind much in this one if you don’t want to. What’s best about Fuligin is its clean and interesting storyline, and the ability to catch all Pokemon in the game.<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h2><span>16.Pokemon Victory Fire</span></h2><p>– Created By 1158<br>– See It On Amazon<br>Play as a boy or a girl who are on a quest to become the greatest trainers in the Tyron region. Starting from a dream come true, you will receive your first Pokemon. You decide you want to leave your hometown to become the best trainer you can be, but then professor Ivan is under attack by Team Mirage members. Team Mirage is a very mysterious gang. Not much is known about them, only that they are bad and planning something big for the region. Stopping them and finding out what they are up to is your main quest while encountering, battling and catching Pokemon from GEN 4 and 5. The English grammar is off a bit, but the story and graphics make this one a very fun and engaging experience.</p><div><br></div><h2><span>15. Pokemon Ruby Destiny Series</span></h2><p>– Created By destinedjagold<br>– See It On Amazon<br>Pokemon Ruby Destiny is a solid series of four completed hacks named “Reign of Legends”, “Rescue Rangers”, “Life of Guardians”, and “Broken Timeline” (Play in this order). The earliest game dated all the way back to 2007. All games have stories that connect to one another and should be played in the correct order. They are all pretty good and interesting, a worthy series to try out. Best to check out the link below to get the full scoop about these. (There are too many high lights to talk about, and this is just a top list :D).<br>– See It On Amazon<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h2><span>14. Pokemon ShinyGold Sigma</span></h2><h3 id='pokemon-rom-hacks-online-free'>Pokemon Rom Hacks online, free</h3><p>– Created By Aiolia.leo<br>– See It On Amazon<br>Pokemon ShinyGold Sigma is a fire red hack on steroids. Many improvements have been implemented in the Johto Region. With even more regions added such as Kanto, Orange Archipelago, and Battle Frontier. If you want to catch Pokemon this is one of the larger hacks, featuring over 850 Pokemon to catch with Mega Evolution’s. Some special touches like gym leaders offering rematches are cool and new characters, sprites, places, and music are all done well. The story is pretty cool also, but a bit everywhere. Shiny Gold is a good one if you want hours and hours of gameplay and Mega Evolution’s.<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h2><span>13. Pokemon Snakewood</span></h2><p>– Created By Cutlerine<br>– See It On Amazon<br>You awaken in a town that is infested with Zombie Pokemon (You can catch them and Battle), monsters and people. This zombie plague is spreading fast. You and Prof. Birch are on a quest to find your brother and Prof. Birch’s daughter who has been missing for a while. In this world, you don’t know who is telling the truth and who isn’t. You will encounter new areas like the hidden Meathouse, the maddening Island and Hoenn University of Film. Snakewood has a darker theme than many other hacks, but I would say it’s still rated PG for the most part. The zombie story is told well and the theme is executed brilliantly. I freaked out when I first encountered a zombie Pikachu lol. There are difficulty spikes, so be sure to level grind often.</p><h2><span>12. Pokemon Clover</span></h2><p>– Created By Squeetz<br>Clover is currently an incomplete rom hack that is already very impressive with more than 8 gyms added, a new region called Fochun, 386 original fakemon to catch and battle with. Play as a young trainer from Veeper town of Fochun, who is on a journey to collect badges. Team Karma is the group standing in your way. A lot of new little touches in this one stand out like audio, wonder trading and new custom and existing items. Hopefully, the developer continues to update this because it’s a great one. Gotta Love The Fakemons!<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h2><span>11. Pokemon Sweet</span></h2><p><br>In Pokemon Sweet, you will start out in a region that looks like Kanto but made entirely out of candy and sweets. This hack is unique in every way. It’s fun to capture or craft candified Pokemon while filling up the pages of your cookbook. This game is all about exploring, finding hidden items and capturing. You will be rewarded for your efforts in very sweet ways :D. I ranked this one so high because it was enjoyable and had a unique theme with some new gameplay elements. People and rivals are all about the sweets here in Kanto now. It’s a great one to play for candy lovers, xD!<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h2><span>10. Pokemon Liquid Crystal</span></h2><p>– Created By linkandzelda<br>– See It On Amazon<br>This is a complete remake of Pokemon Crystal from the Gameboy Color ported to the Gameboy Advance. Jam-packed with many new improvements, extra events and a brand new region known as the Orange Islands. All original events are included plus the extras. The main features and additions to this version include updated graphics and maps, real-time Day and Night, new music, weather effects, New region (Orange Islands), new hidden areas and new gameplay elements. It’s an amazing hack that’s technically finished, but the developer says it will be eventually updated with even more content. It’s a safe bet, that you will probably enjoy Liquid Crystal if you enjoyed the original Pokemon Crystal.<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h2><span>9. Pokemon DarkRising Series</span></h2><p>– Created By DarkRisingGirl<br>– See It On Amazon<br>The DarkRising series is high quality. Many Pokemon gamers consider these to be some of the best hacks around. For others, they are a turn off because of the difficulty level. They are a bit challenging, it just means you have to level grind more and choose your fights a bit more carefully. These games are large. With over 5 generations of Pokemons to catch, new attacks, new characters, and a new region. It really does feel like a retail Pokemon game in certain ways. <a href='/welcome-to-the-game-ii.html' title='Welcome to the game ii guide'>Welcome to the game ii guide</a>. The story for each of these games is very imaginative, interesting, and all are connected to one another. Overall if you are up for a neat story and challenging gameplay give this series a try.<br>– More Information &amp; Downloads: DarkRising, DarkRising 2, DarkRising Order Destroyed, Darkrising Origins Worlds Collide</p><h2><span>8. Pokemon Adventure – Red Chapter</span></h2><p>– Created By Aethestode<br>A really neat hack that follows the Pokemon Red Chapter Manga exactly with some extra events added in. The main character named Red is on a quest to become the best Pokemon trainer ever. There are many obstacles in his way through, such as rival Blue and Green as well as Team Rocket. The graphics and sprites are new in this one and done nicely. Red Chapter is not finished yet but already feels completed and of high quality, the developer says he will continue to update it even more. A lot of regions are available to explore such as Kanto, Johto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Orre, Sevii Island, Orange Archipelago, Decolore Archipelago, and Nanomi Mirage Island.</p><h2><span>7.Pokemon Flora Sky</span></h2><p>– Created By 12345<br>– See It On Amazon<br>This is an old hack from 2011. I played it years ago and remember loving it. The Final unofficial Dex Version was recently released in 2016. You can really tell the developer cared a lot about this hack by the way the story is told, about these legendary Pokemon. The story is about defending against mega powers that want to control different types of Pokemon to rule the world. The new features added are the story, characters, attack moves, legendary Pokemon, events, and 386 different Pokemon to catch with all new sprites. It might feel a bit outdated for some but I believe its still among the best.<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h2><span>6. Pokemon Ash Gray</span></h2><p>– Created By metapod23<br>– See It On Amazon<br>Pokemon Ash Gray is inspired by the original Pokemon anime cartoon series. You play as Ash Ketchum with Pikachu by your side. Ash is on a quest to become the best Pokemon trainer ever. In this adventure, you will come across over 116 events from the anime with two from the original Pokemon movie. Every Pokemon that Ash catches from the shows, you can catch in this game. It’s a very well done tribute to Ash Ketchum and the Pokemon anime’s.<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h2><span>5. Pokemon Resolute</span></h2><p>– Created By 1158<br>– See It On Amazon<br>A really well-made hack with Mega Evolution’s. This is actually the squeal to “Pokemon Victory Fire” (Our #16 ranked hack). Resolute has a very mysterious engaging story that works well and feels tough. Team Mirage is trying to rise up once again and push out a reform against the people. What is this reform? Play to find out. All Pokemon from gen 1,2,3 are here, some from 5,6,7 are also available to catch. You will be playing through the Sylon, Tyron, Johto regions. This game originally had very poor grammar but has been patched with much better English.<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><img src='https://archive-media-0.nyafuu.org/vp/image/1400/92/1400929896174.png' alt='Online' title='Online'><img src='https://techcodex.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/10-Best-Pokemon-Hacked-GBA-ROMs.png' alt='Pokemon Rom Hacks Online' title='Pokemon Rom Hacks Online'><h2><span>4. Pokemon Vega Minus</span></h2><img src='https://i.ytimg.com/vi/SLIw5gIch5c/maxresdefault.jpg' alt='Pokemon rom hacks online' title='Pokemon rom hacks online'><p>– Created By Dr. Akimbo &amp; MKCocoon<br>– See It On Amazon<br>Pokemon Vega is the best hack for Fakemons. The Fakemons are all new with over 181 to catch. Vega also includes 56 Pokemon from newer generations. Along with the new pokemon, over 70 new attack moves have been added to Vega. You also get to play in a brand new region known as Tohoak. By far the best foreign-language hack ever created, glad it was eventually patched to English. The Vega Minus version makes things a bit easier. Gets rid of all the minor frustrating areas and difficulties of VEGA. I would recommend the Minus version if you decide to play this, but the original game is just fine also.<br>– More Information &amp; Download   Minus Version Here</p><h2><span>3. Pokemon Gaia</span></h2><p>– Created By Spherical Ice<br>Pokemon Gaia is very impressive already. The developer is not finished with it (6 gyms so far), but the game already feels high in quality. Gaia could pass off as a retail Pokemon game when it’s finished and will definitely be the best GBA rom hack so far (In my opinion). The new Orbtus region is very impressive, with a lot to explore and see. The graphics are very clean in Gaia, even better than official GBA Pokemon games. Some of the new features include Mega evolution’s, new items and moves, rock climbing and a few mini-games. Best of all is the story and characters, but I won’t spoil it for you, just play this game right now!<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h2><span>2. Pokemon Light Platinum</span></h2><h3 id='pokemon-rom-hacks-online-computer'>Pokemon Rom Hacks Online Computer</h3><p>– Created By Wesley FG<br>– See It On Amazon<br>Pokemon Light Platinum originally released in 2012, and the final release was on February 25th, 2017. Many Pokemon gamers still consider Light Platinum to be the greatest Pokemon hack ever created. I agree it is amazing in every way. The story and everything that is new like the Zhery region, legendary Pokemon, new rivals and graphics fit together almost perfectly. So good, that developers are working hard on a remake for the Nintendo DS. A must play, if you are interested in checking a few GBA hacks out, make sure you download this one also.<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h2><span>1. Pokemon Glazed</span></h2><p>– Created By redriders180<br>– See It On Amazon<br>Until Gaia is finished, Pokemon Glazed is my favorite hack and is among the highest quality of the completed hacks. The journey has so many ups and downs in it, keeping the excitement and drama high. I became very invested in the characters, regions, and story. The regions include Tunod, Johto, and Rankor. The difficulty feels perfect in Glazed, not a walk in the park in some areas, but not impossible either. You don’t need to level grind too much. Overall I think Glazed is a must download and play. I really can’t see anyone who loves Pokemon games, not liking Glazed. I actually liked it better than some of the official games.<br>– More Information &amp; Download</p><h3 id='pokemon-rom-hacks-online'>Pokemon Rom Hacks Online</h3><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> You might want to check out my articles featuring the 10 Best Pokemon Fan Games So Far.
