Konami Platforms, Platform of origin PlayStation March 15, 2001 September 12, 2017 Pro Evolution Soccer ( PES;: ワールドサッカーウイニングイレブン Wārudo Sakkā Uining Ireben, World Soccer: Winning Eleven or simply Winning Eleven), is a series of developed and published.</p><p>It is a spinoff from Konami's earlier series. Every year, the game is released around late September and/or early October with two different titles: World Soccer: Winning Eleven in Japan and Asia (excluding Indonesia), and Pro Evolution Soccer in Europe, North America and Indonesia. The Japanese version is a localized version that features local leagues. Partially as a result of ' affinity to purchasing exclusive rights for their, the games have historically lacked the sheer volume of licenses present in EA's offerings, with the most notable absences being the and. As such, team jerseys, names and players may be inaccurate.</p><p>Was the face of the franchise, appearing on the front cover in, and. He has since been replaced by for, who was replaced by and for.</p><p>As of December 2011, the Pro Evolution Soccer franchise has been localized into 19 languages and available in 62 countries. As of December 2012, the series have been sold more than 81.65 million copies worldwide, making it. Contents. Game modes and features Master league The Master League mode, gives the user control of a team of user's selection. Originally, the players were all generic-fictional players, however this later changed giving the user the option to change the settings and choose to play with default players.</p><p>These players have become cult figures to many people playing the Master League. The aim is to use these players and gain points by winning matches, cups and leagues. Using acquired points to purchase real players to join the team. Ultimately, one should end up with a team of skilled players. From Winning Eleven 7, players' growth and decline curves were added, where a player's statistics may improve or decline, depending on training and age. This added a new depth to purchasing players, adding value to an up-and-coming youngster whose abilities rise dramatically and creating a trade-off if the player buys skilled but declining veterans. Editing Fans of the series often make 'option files' and 'patches' which modify all player names into those of their real life counterparts, as well as including transfers from the latest transfer window and, occasionally, altered stats of more obscure players whose in-game attributes do not precisely replicate their real life skills.</p><p>'PES Stats Database' and 'PES Stats' are examples of websites that are dedicated to creating accurate stats for players. These are distributed via the internet in digital format, then transferred to the PlayStation 2 memory card using hardware such as the Max Drive. More experienced gamers often use 'patches', editing the actual game code and modifying the graphical content to include accurate kits for unlicensed teams, new stadiums, and footballs from, and, as well as more balls. Most patches also contain licensed referee kits from and the official logos of the various European leagues.</p><p>These patches are technically a breach of copyright, and are often sold illegally in territories in the and. Konami have become less tolerant of this kind of fan editing in recent years, and now the data pertaining to kits and player statistics in each new release. However, fan communities invariably find ways to crack this encryption, and patches still appear once this has been achieved. Since Pro Evolution Soccer 6 onwards, there has been a separate league with 18 generic teams (Team A, Team B, Team C etc.) present, which can be edited fully.</p><p>This is thought to be due to the fact that Konami failed to get the rights to the German Bundesliga, and is usually made into the Bundesliga or another league of one's preference by patch makers. However, most people use this to put their edited players into playable teams from the start instead of having to play through Master League to purchase them or alternatively edit the existing non-generic teams. This feature does not appear in the Wii version of the game (but, as stated above, the non-generic teams can be edited anyway). Goal Storm / ISS Pro series Pro Evolution Soccer series traces its roots to Goal Storm (also known as World Soccer Winning Eleven in Japan).</p><p>The game was developed by Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo, Inc. And was released in 1996. The original Winning Eleven game, without the World Soccer prefix, was released only in Japan for the PlayStation in 1995, and featured only the teams that played on. The following three games in the series were also produced by and they were released under the name of ISS Pro for the European market and Winning Eleven for the rest of the world.</p><img src='https://spacexzone.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Cover16-283x220.jpg' alt='Winning Eleven Ps1 Bahasa Inggris' title='Winning Eleven Ps1 Bahasa Inggris'><p>Main article: Tagline: 'They Will Rock You' Pro Evolution Soccer 2 ( World Soccer: Winning Eleven 6 in Japan and World Soccer Winning Eleven 6 International in the US) is the 2nd installment and was released in October 2002 and some felt that it was a slight backwards step from the original Pro Evolution Soccer. Others argued that it had improved. The pace of gameplay was much faster than in the game's older sibling, with sharper turns and quicker reactions to tackles. It also included a training session mode. Extra clubs were added, with an extra Master League division.</p><p>There were two new commentators, and, but this aspect of the game was criticised for the commentators' inaccuracies and tendency to speak over each other. The licensing was much the same, but infamously all Dutch players were called ‘Oranges’, because Konami did not hold the rights from the, for use from Dutch players (in fact, plenty of other football games of the period with FIFPro licenses also saw this happen to them - including -, following Netherlands' unsuccessful campaign at the 2002 World Cup qualifiers). Also, unlike in the original game, the 'unofficial' club names stopped using obvious city names (e.g. Was Manchester, was Madrid etc.), and instead used very ambiguous names (e.g. Manchester United were now Aragon, Liverpool became Europort and West Ham became Lake District). The edit mode included a club editor which offset this problem to some extent, with editable kits and logos as well as club and player names. The game notably included tracks from: and.</p><p>A version (known as World Soccer Winning Eleven 2002 in Japan) was also released, which was again a minor update of its predecessor, and was the last Pro Evolution Soccer release for the original PlayStation. Pro Evolution Soccer 3.</p><p>Main article: Tagline: 'The Season Starts Here' Pro Evolution Soccer 3 ( World Soccer: Winning Eleven 7 in Japan and World Soccer Winning Eleven 7 International in the US) is the 3rd installment in the series and was released in 2003, and featured the Italian referee on the cover (although bizarrely he is not present as an in-game referee). The most significant update was the overhaul in the graphics engine, with more life like players and much improved likeness. The gameplay was changed to accompany this, with more fast-paced action than that of PES2, a much better physics engine, additions such as the advantage rule improved passing and long-ball functions, while as per usual, more licenses (with the infamous Dutch Oranges removed, replaced with pseudonyms such as 'Froibaad' in the place of Kluivert), more club teams and the Master League is now split into regional divisions, with competitions equivalent to the and the and as was no longer revived, the company has been replaced. Pro Evolution Soccer 3 is the first in the series (3rd overall) to be released for and was well received by the PC games magazines but criticized by fans for its lack of online mode and bloated system requirements at its time, particularly not supporting the common Geforce MX series. Its rival, had online functions and had more modest system requirements in comparison. The game was essentially a direct conversion of the PlayStation 2 code, albeit with sharper graphics and is easier to download fan made mods for the game.</p><p>Pro Evolution Soccer 4. Main article: Tagline: 'The long road to the Final' Pro Evolution Soccer 4 ( World Soccer: Winning Eleven 8 in Japan and World Soccer Winning Eleven 8 International in the US) was the 4th installment in the series and was released in 2004; featuring referee, and on the cover. This is the first Pro Evolution Soccer game to feature full leagues, namely the English, French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Dutch top divisions, though with full league licenses only for the latter three. As a result, clubs in, for example, the English League, an unlicensed league, have ambiguous names like 'West London Blue' and 'Man Red' for and respectively, and their home grounds and are respectively named 'Blue Bridge' and 'Trad Brick Stadium'.</p><p>The gameplay has improved from Pro Evolution Soccer 3 (though not as much of a significant leap as its predecessor) with improved AI, tweaked play-on advantages and better throughballs. Dribbling is tighter with the players (though at one-star difficulty, a player receiving the ball on either wing can dribble the ball down the length of the pitch relatively uncontested), plus free-kicks have been changed to allow lay-offs. The gameplay was criticized for its relatively easy scoring opportunities, as players can pass their way through opposing defenses, or hold on to the ball at the edge of the penalty area and simply wait for the opposing defenders to move away and thus give him space to shoot.</p><h2>Download Winning Eleven For Pc</h2><p>A new 6-star difficulty was added as an unlockable in the shop, as well as the previous items, while the Master League included enhancements such as player development, so many players over 30 would see certain attributes decline as the game progresses. Conversely, players could improve upon their attributes up to the age of 24-25, though the improvement is most rapid and obvious in players aged 22 and under. The edit mode has been enhanced rapidly, with the options to add text and logos to shirts (essentially sponsors) and pixel logo editing as well as the traditional preset shapes, thus making it easier to replicate a team. The game also includes an 'International Cup' and four regional Cups:.</p><h2>Winning Eleven English Psx Iso</h2><p>The 'European Cup' is remarkably inclusive, including almost every major European country, as well as smaller countries like, and.

The improvements are mainly tweaks to the gameplay engine, while online play finally made it to the PlayStation 2 version. The game was perceived as much harder by fans, with a very punishing defense AI making it harder to score. Some players have pointed out inconsistencies in the star difficulty rating, such as 3 star mode being harder to beat than 6 star due to its more defensive nature, but in general scoring is harder. Referees are very fussy over decisions, awarding free kicks for very negligible challenges. There are various new club licenses present, including, and a few other European clubs, as well as the full Dutch, Spanish and Italian Leagues. Since crowd animations on the PS2 version slowed down the framerate to an unplayable level in the testing phase, crowds were rendered as 2D animated bitmaps which, on certain angles, become unsees, making the stands appear empty; however, fully 3D-rendered crowds are present during cut-scenes.</p><p>There are however which address this in the PC version, although no official patch was released.

The PC version does not utilize the Xbox 360 engine but is a conversion of the PS2 edition. The PSP version is similar in many ways to its PS2 brother, while the DS version has graphics and gameplay reminiscent of the older PES series on the original. A criticism of the previous version was that the game was too unforgiving and so suppressed fluid attacking football.</p><p>Pro Evolution Soccer 6 was issued with more tricks and an overall more attacking mentality, but whether it does make it easier to take on defenders and get forward is debatable. More licenses were added, including fully licensed international kits including the nations, and to name a few (as well as the ever-present Japan license).</p><p>The French is now included as fully licensed league, as well as the Spanish, Italian and Dutch leagues, plus several other individual clubs.

All teams which competed at the World Cup featured their 23-man squads from the tournament, including those who retired from international football (e.g. Of the ) and from the game altogether (e.g. Of ), although club teams were fairly up to date. The version features next-generation, hi-definition graphics and more animations, but gameplay similar to the other console versions, according to a recent interview with Seabass.</p><p>The Xbox 360 version also finally introduces the Pro Evolution series to widescreen gaming, a feature that was sorely missing from the PS2 and versions of the game. Much of the gameplay and editing options were severely stripped down for the 360 release. Pro Evolution Soccer 2008. Main article: Pro Evolution Soccer 2008 (Known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 2008) is the 7th installment in the series.

While in some respects keeping the same structure of its predecessor, PES 2009 makes a large number of improvements, starting from the graphics, now better suited for image technologies. Also, the overall pace of the gameplay was slowed down, with a better AI for computer-controlled teammates as well: they will look for better passing spaces and goal routes.</p><p>A new addition of this game is the Become a Legend mode, which follows the entire career of a single player (as opposed to a whole team, like in the Master League) as he moves to better teams, achieves national team caps and wins MVP awards, like the similar mode called Fantasista in, a special edition only for Japan. This also inspired the Be a Pro mode introduced in.
