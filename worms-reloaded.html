The game was first released on Microsoft Windows via Steam, on August 26, 2010.<sup>[1]</sup></p><p><i>Reloaded</i> is a port of <i>Worms 2: Armageddon</i>, a sequel to the 2007 <i>Worms</i> console port.<sup>[<i><span>citation needed</span></i>]</sup></p><h2><span>Gameplay</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><div>Gameplay</div><img src='https://slotsspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/worms-reloaded-blueprint-gaming-slot-game-logo.png' alt='Mac OS X' title='Mac OS X'><p><i>Worms Reloaded</i> is a turn basedartillery game, in which players command a team of up to four worms. During each turn, players control only one worm from their teams. In the standard gameplay, the objective is to eliminate all enemy worms and be the last team standing. There is also a 'race' mode where the objective is to reach the end point in less time.</p><p>When 'Artillery' mode is not enabled, worms can move across the landscape. Movement is primarily accomplished through crawling and jumping, but items such as the jet pack and ninja rope can enable much faster travel and access to more terrain. The player has a preset amount of time to move or attack with the worm before the turn ends (5 to 90 seconds). Once the player uses a weapon, the 'escape' timer starts, giving up to five seconds to move the worm to a safe position before the turn ends.</p><p><i>Reloaded</i> features a wide variety of weapons, some based on real weapons and others imaginary. Some weapons fire in straight line, such as the shotgun, but many such as grenades and bazooka shells follow curved trajectories (from gravity and wind) and can attack distant targets behind obstacles. Several animal weapons such as the sheep and ferrets will move along the landscape and then explode. There are also several 'air strike'-type weapons which are dropped from the sky towards the intended target.</p><p>A worm can be killed in two ways, either by having its health reduced to zero or by falling into the water below the landscape and drowning.</p><p>Weapons, utilities (such as jet packs and blowtorches), and health kits can be randomly airdropped into the level if selected as part of the game scheme.</p><h2><span>Customization</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><p>As seen in previous <i>Worms</i> titles, customization stands as a prominent aspect of <i>Worms Reloaded</i>. Players can create their own teams of Worms, choosing the names of the teams and naming each of the team's four worms. Each team also selects a voice set, victory dance, grave marker, skin color, and wearable hats, among other features. Many of the voice sets are classics from previous titles.</p><p>Players can also modify or create multiplayer game schemes, which define the gameplay rules and available weapons during matches. For example, the turn length can be adjusted, and the players can choose what objects may randomly spawn on the landscape. Additionally, <i>Reloaded</i> allows players to define the starting inventory of every weapon, and how long before that weapon becomes available for use. If weapon crate airdrops are enabled, more weapons will randomly drop to the landscape over the course of a game.</p><p>Installation instructions Download the installer from the Visual Studio for Mac download page.

The game automatically fills the terrain's shape in with a landscape texture when the level is finished. Additionally, players can import full-color levels in image format.</p><p>While still flexible, the customization in <i>Reloaded</i> is simplified when compared to older PC titles. For example, <i>Worms Armageddon</i> allowed the player to choose for each individual weapon how likely that weapon was to appear in a weapon crate. <i>Reloaded</i> does not offer any control over which weapons can appear in crates or how frequently. Likewise, players can no longer adjust the power of each weapon individually. Team size has been reduced from eight to four, and sudden death scenarios have been reduced.</p><h2><span>Development</span><span><span>[</span>edit<span>]</span></span></h2><h3 id='worms-reloaded-weapons'>Worms Reloaded Weapons</h3><p>The game is largely based upon <i>Worms 2: Armageddon</i> (released on Xbox Live Arcade in 2009), but is said to be an 'extended edition of the console versions of late.' Team17 released few details or media content concerning the title before release, and a press release is not available.

THQ used to develop these games, but in this online slot variation, Blueprint Gaming take the wheel. Slots such as this one exist solely thanks to the dedication and passion from the fans of the original game. Worms is a classic, and was only ever going to be made into a legitimate online slot. Worms is one of the earliest games we can personally remember, which is why it is getting the online slot treatment. Blueprint Gaming are one of the more reputable developers, meaning you should trust that what they’re creating is something that is worthwhile and something you should be encouraged to put your money into.</p><p>If any of you can remember what worms looked like, then you will be happy to know that the developer has purposely tried to re-create this slot in its image. The graphics run very fluidly, and very rarely slow down despite some of the action on these reels being quite fast. Like many online slots out there by the same developer, Worms Reloaded is a 5 reel by 20 pay-line slot that is stocked with various features and gameplay elements that make it a must play for any plans of the series. There is a jackpot for players to aim towards. Anyone looking to re-live that nostalgia should play this slot instantly. If you are you are still unsure, then be sure to read the rest of our review to see if anything stands out.</p><h2>Expectation vs Reality</h2><p>Being based on something so popular can put a lot of pressure on the shoulders of developers. Capturing the same magic that the original Worms games had, to some would appear impossible. Blueprint Gaming have not let nerves get the better of them, as this slot is very well made and might be our favourite adapted slot of all time (yes we played Worms so maybe we’re biased). Worms Reloaded is a very fun and chaotic slot that captures the same feelings of carnage that the original games had. We could easily see other Worms related slots appearing in the near future (hopefully from the same developer as they did a great job with this one).</p><h2>About the Game</h2><p>There will be some of you out there who see the thumbnail or the name of this slot and will want to play it not expecting it to be nothing like the original game, and that’s because it isn’t. This is an online slot, and the rules here are a lot different in many different ways. First of all, you couldn’t win cash in the original Worms, all you could win was the admiration that your worm lived at the end despite the destruction around him. In this 3D slot the same animations can be found it’s just that this time the more destruction you cause on these reels, the higher your score will go. In order to win in this slot you will need to match symbols from the left to the right of the screen. All the symbols here come in the form of the worm characters, as well as low value symbols that will help push scores up the pay-table no matter how small. The colours and graphics, as we’ve previously mentioned, provide players with immersive gameplay that continues to amaze us now, despite playing so many games already.</p><img src='https://cdn.dlcompare.com/game_tetiere/upload/gameimage/file/12994.png' alt='Game' title='Game'><h2>Bonus Games and Bonus Features</h2><p>Worms Reloaded is not without the various bonus games and bonus features that all alter gameplay in some way shape or form. These features will seem awfully familiar to players who do play online slots, but to those playing these games for the first time, they can be quite confusing/frustrating at first. This is why we would recommend that players play a handful of spins on a low amount before they try something a little more serious. We know that there is that urge to play as soon as possible seeing as this is Worms, but you’re going to have to take your time if you wish to master this battlefield.</p><p>WILDS: Wild symbols will substitute out various symbols on the reels for the scatter. The more wilds that you can string together the higher your scores will go. Wilds are a slots bread and butter, which makes them a basic requirement in any online slot.</p><p>SCATTERS: Scatter symbols will throw around certain symbols on the reels, thus giving you more opportunities to score high. Scatters will unlock free spins whenever matched on the reels. The importance of the scatter is that they can offer these free spins which have additional multipliers involved.</p><h2>Hit or Miss?</h2><p>We’ll keep this nice and short, if you were a fan of any of the Worms games then you should be playing Worms Reloaded from developer Blueprint Gaming. They have gone above and beyond one more time creating a slot that nostalgic gamers will no doubt fall in love with. Play Worms Reloaded today!</p><h2>Other Games by Blueprint Gaming</h2><p>You’d think that with a name like Blueprint Gaming you’d get the most thought-out slots going, and you’d be correct in thinking that.
